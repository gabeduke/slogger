$ slog_

  All the commands are implemented as plugins in the
  `slogge.commands` package.  If a python module is
  placed named "cmd_foo" it will show up as "foo"
  command and the `cli` object within it will be
  loaded as nested Click command.

Usage:

  $ pip install --editable .
  $ slog --help
